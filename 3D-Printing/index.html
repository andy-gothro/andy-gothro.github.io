      <h1>3D-Printing</h1>
        <p>I have been working with 3D-printers for 6 years, and I am familiar with design specifically for additive manufacturing. I own my own 3D-printer which enables me to print functional parts and parts for fun. I am a big fan of rapid prototyping and iterative design.</p>

					<p>I often print functional parts for myself and the clubs/classes I'm in, this is a printed steering knuckle for test-fit on Baja car</p>

					<p>#D-Printing allows me to practive iterative prototyping of intricate or complex parts quickly and easily.</p>
