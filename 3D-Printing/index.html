	<h2>My 3D-Printing experience</h2>
		<center>
      		<p>I have been working with 3D-printers for 6 years, and I am familiar with design specifically for additive manufacturing. I own my own 3D-printer which enables me to print both functional parts and things for fun. I am a big fan of rapid prototyping and iterative design. My senior design capstone project is a 5-axis capable, nonplanar 3d printer, enabling more complex and mechanically strong manufacturing with 3d printers.</p>

		<p>I often print functional parts for myself and the clubs/classes I'm in, this is a printed steering knuckle for test-fit on Baja car</p></p>

		<p>3D-Printing allows me to practive iterative prototyping of intricate or complex parts quickly and easily.</p></p>

		<p>I also print things which are just cool and don't serve any particularly useful purpose.</p></p>
