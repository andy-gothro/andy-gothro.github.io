			<h2>Addressing issues found at competition:</h2>
			<p>Following the competition, I took on a different system redesign, the rear suspension.
	Of course things don't always go as planned, and we had some components break, which I led a redesign of afterward.
	The rear bearing carrier which attached the rear wheels to the driveshaft and suspension arms broke during the endurance event.</p>

			<h2>In the future:</h2>
			<p>As we move to a four-wheel-drive system, I am leading the design process and implementation of our own drivetrain components for the first time. I have created an initial version of a differential which we would use to drive the front wheels:</p>
