      <h1>Baja SAE</h1>
      <h2>I was the Technical President of Gonzaga's Baja SAE team, and here is a collection of the work I've done:</h2>
      <h2>My first major design project as a part of the Baja SAE team was as steering lead During my sophomore year. The preceding year, the front steering knuckle was one of the major points of failure during competition, and need addressing.</h2>

		<p>During the competition, the front steering knuckle failed after a crash. The attachment point for the tie rod, which steers the wheel, was mounted in a cantilever setup, which when overstressed yielded due to both the tensile stress and torsion. The lower suspension mount also failed in shear due to an error in manufacturing making it thinner than designed.</p>

		<p>During the event, the broken knucle was repaired by welding replacement mounting pieces onto the knuckle, which was successful, though difficult and cost a great deal of time during the 4 hour endurance race.</p>

			<h2>Addressing new issues found at competition:</h2>
			<p>Following the competition, I took on a different system redesign, the rear suspension.
	Of course things don't always go as planned, and we had some components break, which I led a redesign of afterward.
	The rear bearing carrier which attached the rear wheels to the driveshaft and suspension arms broke during the endurance event-twice, once on each side of the car.</p>

		    <img src="baja car 4.jpg" width="360" height="360" 			alt="car in pits">
		    <p>During the 4 hour endurance race, we were forced to bring the car into the pits to perform major maintenance on the car twice to replace the rear bearing carriers on both sides. This cost us quite a bit of time during this fast-paced event.</p>

		  <div class="column">
		    <img src="broken bearing carrier 1.jpg" width="360" height="360"	alt="broken bearing carrier and bent suspension">
		    <p>Both times, the lower mount of the bearing carrier failed, leading to the rest of the suspension bendinf around itself as it came to a stop. Thankfully only the bearing carrier itself was permanently broken.</p>

		    <p>In this close-up of the failed piece it is clear that the part failed in bearing stress. This mount bore the entire load of the suspension and was the only place where any twisting forces were resisted, including the tractive force of the wheel.</p>

		    <img src="broken bearing carrier 3.jpg" width="360" height="360" 	alt="close up of both broken bearing carriers">

		  <div class="column">
		    <img src="v1 8-17-19.JPG" width="640" height="360" 			alt="render of the revised suspension setup">
		    <p>As a first concept at addressing the failures, I chose to explore a different suspension structure, instead of using a single small mount where the previous one failed, I chose to use a wider design to both lower the stress concentration and resist any torques.</p>

		  <div class="column">
		    <img src="bearing carrier analysis 1.png" width="480" height="360"	alt="solidworks simulation of the new bearing carrier">
		    <p>I performed several different load analyses for this part, including the situation in shich the previous ones failed and other worst-case scenarios.</p>

		</div>
			<center><img src="bearing carrier cad 1.png" width="630" height="755" 		alt="close-up in solidworks of the new bearing carrier">
			<p>In addition to making a more durable design, I incorporated more adjustment into the attachment of the pieces, using ball-joints to adjust the alignment of the wheel.</p></center>

		  <div class="column">
		    <img src="rear bearing carrier.jpg" width="640" height="360" 			alt="final version of the rear bearing carrier">
		    <p>Through the design iteration process, I opted to mimic the design of the front suspension for the new rear bearing carriers. This design is made of two bolted parts, to reduce machining complexity.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="column">
		    <img src="rear suspension assembly snip.jpg" width="480" height="360"	alt="solidworks render of the rear suspension">
		    <p>The new design of the rear bearing carrier allowed for the simplification of the rear suspension, making it function extremely similarly to the successful design of the front supension on the previous car.</p>

			<h2>Drivetrain work:</h3>
			<p>As we moved to a four-wheel-drive system, I led the design process and implementation of our own drivetrain components for the first time. I created an initial version of a differential which we would use to drive the front wheels:</p>
