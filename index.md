## Welcome to my web portfolio!

I am a mechanical engineering student at Gonzaga University, and here is a collection of my work in my clubs and classes.

### Here are some pictures of the work I have done as of the Baja club, mostly steering and suspension components as well as the car at the competition in 2019:

I am the technical president of Gonzaga's SAE Baja team, leading the design, manufacturing and assembly of our off-road buggy each year.
