## First off, some stuff about me

I am a mechanical engineering student at Gonzaga University, and this is a collection of my work in my clubs and classes. I have over 6 years of experience with Soliwdorks across many classes and clubs, as well as Matlab from several classes at Gonzaga. I am the technical president of Gonzaga's Baja SAE team, and Integration/Design lead of the ASME Rocketry club.

## Here are some pictures of the work I have done as of the Baja club, mostly steering and suspension components I worked on as well as the car at the competition in 2019:

My main project last year was the front steering knuckle, which had failed in previous years.

Of course things don't always go as planned, and we had some components break, which I led a redesign of afterwards.
The rear bearing carrier which attached the rear wheels to the driveshaft and suspension arms broke during the endurance event.

Twice!

Both sides had the same issue, with the lower mount suffering from way too much bearing stress.
So I redesigned the rear suspension to avoid such concentrated loads:

And I ran a FE analysis on the part and it held up!

In the future, as We move to a four-wheel-drive system, we are designing and building our own drivetrain components or the first time, and I have created an initial version of a differential which we would use to drive the front wheels:

## My ASME Rocketry work

As Integration lead, I mainly make sure that the motor, avionics, and recovery systems work together properly. I use an open-source rocket construction tool, Openrocket, to determine weight balance, stability, and maximum altitude based on the components we use.

## My 3d-printing experience

I have been working with 3d-printers for 6 years, and I am familiar with design specifically for additive manufacturing. I own my own 3d-printer which enables me to print functional parts and parts for fun. I am a big fan of rapid prototyping and iterative design

## My Matlab experience

At Gonzaga university, I've learned basic Matlab skills, and the biggest project I've done was a program to model sound levels, seat placement, and pricing for theaters of any size. The program I developed for this also produces 3d visualizations of the results.
