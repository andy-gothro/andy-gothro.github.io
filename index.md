# Welcome to my web portfolio!

About me:

I am a mechanical engineering student at Gonzaga University, and this is a collection of my work in my clubs and classes.
I have over 6 years of experience with Soliwdorks across many classes and clubs, as well as Matlab from several classes at Gonzaga.

## Here are some pictures of the work I have done as of the Baja club, mostly steering and suspension components I worked on as well as the car at the competition in 2019:

Of course things don't always go as planned, and we had some components break, which I led a redesign of afterwards.
The rear bearing carrier which attached the rear wheels to the driveshaft and suspension arms broke during the endurance event.

Twice!

Both sides had the same issue, with the lower mount suffering from way too much bearing stress.
So I redesigned the rear suspension to avoid such concentrated loads:

And I ran a FE analysis on the part and it held up!

I am the technical president of Gonzaga's SAE Baja team, leading the design, manufacturing and assembly of our off-road buggy each year.

In the future, as We move to a four-wheel-drive system, we are designing and building our own drivetrain components or the first time, and I have created an initial version of a differential which we would use to drive the front wheels:

## My Matlab experience

At Gonzaga university, I've learned basic Matlab skills, and the biggest project I've done was a program to model sound levels, seat placement, and pricing for theaters of any size. The program I developed for this also produces 3d visualizations of the results.
