## Welcome to my web portfolio!

I am a mechanical engineering student at Gonzaga University, and here is a collection of my work in my clubs and classes.

### Here are some pictures of the work I have done as of the Baja club, mostly steering and suspension components I worked on as well as the car at the competition in 2019:

Of course things don't always go as planned, and we had some components break, which I led a redesign of

The part which broke:

Twice!

So I redesigned the rear suspension to avoid such concentrated loads,

And I ran a FE analysis on the part and it held up!

I am the technical president of Gonzaga's SAE Baja team, leading the design, manufacturing and assembly of our off-road buggy each year.

In the future, as We move to a four-wheel-drive system, we are designing and building our own drivetrain components or the first time, and I have created an initial version of a differential which we would use to drive the front wheels:
