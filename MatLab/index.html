    		<h2>I have used MatLab mainly for my courses here at Gonzaga, here are some of the projects I've done:</h2>
	<center><p>Heat transfer anaysis for cooking food-(including flipping)</p>
	<img src="../Animated GIF-downsized_large (1).gif" alt="animation of 2-d heat transfer and center temperature profile"></center>
	<p> For my heat transfer class, I created a 2-D finite difference model for heat transfer through a material. I wrote this program to be extremely adaptable,with variable size, detail, material properties, initial conditions, and end conditions.</p>
	<p>Theater seating plan design program</p>

	<p> I created this program to create a seating plan for a theater design project in my Intro to Engineering course. It can generate 2 types of seating plan given any sized room, and then determine pricing, sound levels, category and handicapped seats.</p>
