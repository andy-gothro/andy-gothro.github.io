	<p> I created this program to create a seating plan for a theater design project in my Intro to Engineering course. It can generate 2 types of seating plan given any sized room, and then determine pricing, sound levels, category and handicapped seats.</p>

	<p> For my heat transfer class, I created a 2-D finite difference model for heat transfer through a material. I wrote this program to be extremely adaptable,with variable size, detail, material properties, initial conditions, and end conditions.</p>
